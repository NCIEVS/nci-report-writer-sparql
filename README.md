# nci-report-writer-sparql
SPARQL-based Report Writer query and reporting tool.

# Overview
The ReportWriter SPARQL application is a prototype for creating reports
using a SPARQL endpoint. This version uses Python 3 and was tested against
an Apache Jena - Fuseki triple store.

# Getting Started
Once you have cloned this code, it is recommended to create an output and
templates directory at the top level. Your current report writer templates
can be placed in the "templates" directory and the "output" directory will
be the location for the output generated by the reportWriter.py program.

If you have generated the documentation as outlined in the "Documentation"
section below, there are more details on running the "reportWriter.py"
program, in addition there is a "run.sh" shell script that can be used as
a model for running th program on a Linux or Mac OS.

# Documentation
Documentation was created using the SPHINX Python Documentation Generator. 
To create the documention, cd to the docs directory and run the "make html"
command. The generated documentation is located in the docs/build/html
directory. Open the "index.html" file in a browser to view the documentation.
